        <p>
          Autonomous cars will coordinate with human-driven cars and pedestrians, assistive robotic manipulators will collaborate with end-users to perform daily living tasks, and autonomous quadrotors will fly through neighborhoods to deliver packages to peoples' homes. Understanding how humans and robots interact requires studying how these <i>systems</i> evolve over time. Where will a pedestrian walk to in the next five seconds? How should a robotic manipulator grab a cup from the shelf and hand it to the person?

        <p>
          In order to start tackling these questions, we need a unifying mathematical language to describe the evolution of autonomous systems over time (whether they be human or robotic).
          Let's start with the component we know most about -- the robot. The robot is a physical system. It turns out that systems (and control) theory provide us a set of powerful frameworks for describing complex physical systems and their behaviors with concise mathematical functions. The framework we will be leaning on during this class is state-space representations. 
        </p>

        <p>[TODO: insert image]</p>

        <p>
          In state-space representations, the system (i.e., robot) has four key components:
          <ol>
            <li> <b>State</b>: \(x(t) \in \mathbb{R}^n\). The state describes the characteristics of interest about a system. For example, it could be the 2D planar position of an agent, their speed, orientation; or it could be the joint configuration of a robot manipulator.</li>
            <li> <b>Control</b> (Action): \(u(t) \in \mathbb{R}^m\). These are the inputs we can choose at each instance in time. For example, acceleration / deceleration and steering for a ground vehicle, or joint torques for a robot manipulator. </li>
            <li> <b>Output</b> (Observation): \(y(t) \in \mathbb{R}^l\). Outputs are what we can measure (typically through sensors). For example, speed through a speedometer, position through GPS, etc. <i>For now, we assume perfect observability of the state: \(y \equiv x\) but in reality we almost never have perfect observability (we have partial observability).</i></li>
            <li> <b>Dynamics</b>: \(f: \mathbb{R}^n \times \mathbb{R}^m \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n\). This is a function which describes how the system state evolves over time.</li>
          </ol> 
        </p>

        <p>
        Typically the dynamics models are either continuous or discrete-time models:
        <ol>
          <li> <b>Continuous-time</b>: \(t \in \mathbb{R}\). This yeilds dynamics that are ODEs: \(\dot{x} = f(x(t), u(t))\). More common in control theory and systems theory.
          </li> <b>Discrete-time</b>: \(t \in \mathbb{Z}\). This yeilds dynamics that are: \(x^{t+1} = f(x^t, u^t)\). More common in RL, AI, and robotics and optimization these days. Sometimes these discrete-time models are obtained via an approximation to continuous-time dynamics:
          \begin{equation}
          x^{t+1} = x^t + \delta t \cdot f(x(t), u(t)) \quad\quad \text{Forward Euler discretization; accurate for small }\delta t
          \end{equation}
        </ol>
        </p>

        <blockquote class="example">
          <b>Example (Simple Car).</b> [TODO: insert image]. Let the state of the autonomous car be the x-y position and the heading angle: \(x := [p_x, p_y, \theta]\). Let the control of the autonomous car be the speed and the steering angle: \(u := [v, \phi]\). Then, the continuous-time dynamics of the system can be described via:
          \begin{equation}
            \dot{x} = f(x,u) = \begin{bmatrix} v \cos(\theta) \\ v \sin(\theta) \\ \frac{v}{L} \tan(\phi) \end{bmatrix}
          \end{equation}
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          Note that the state and control are both functions of time. So, to describe a system's evolution over time, you may often see "trajectory notation". For example, in the continuous time case you may see: 
          \begin{equation}
          x = x(t) = x^\mathbf{u}_{x^0, t_0}(t)
          \end{equation}
          On the left, the notation is clearer, but provides less information. On the right, it is cumbersome but we get a lot of information: specifically, this says "the state achieved at time t starting from state \(x^0\) at time \(t_0\) and applying control signal \(\mathbf{u}(\cdot)\) over time \([t_0, t]\)". A trajectory over an entire time inveral can also be denoted in other ways: \(\mathbf{x}(\cdot), \xi\) are both notations you may see in this class. Similarly, a control function over a time interval may be compactly written as: \(\mathbf{u}(\cdot)\).
